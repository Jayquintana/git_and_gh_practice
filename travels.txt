Favorite Vacation:

My favorite vacation was to Mexico City, a beautiful city despite the history of violence and corrupt cops. I got the chance to see the beautiful and dark side of Mexico City. How there is a huge juxtaposition in the city within blocks. One moment you're in the richest part of the city (Condesa) full of rich europeans and wealthy Mexican families. Next you can be caught in a city know for being the black market and one of the most dangerous areas in the world (Tepito).
